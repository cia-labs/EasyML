# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Node.js: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm or Yarn: npm comes with Node.js installation, but you can also use Yarn as an alternative package manager.
- React Native CLI: Install React Native CLI globally by running `npm install -g react-native-cli`.

### Installing

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashish9738/Which-Images.git
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

First, Navigate to frontend.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**.
To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
